By default, the logging for the cron daemon is not enabled in Debian (I assume it is the system you are using). To enable it, please open the file /etc/rsyslog.conf via

$ vi /etc/rsyslog.conf
and uncomment the line

# cron.*                          /var/log/cron.log
After that, you need to restart rsyslog via

$ /etc/init.d/rsyslog restart
and you will find the cron logs in /var/log/cron.log
